# 0x1B. Web stack debugging #4

## Tasks in this project aim to show you how to set up a web server (nginx) and an application server (Gunicorn).
# 0. Set up development with Python

Let’s serve what you built for AirBnB clone v2 - Web framework on web-01. This task is an exercise in setting up your development environment, which is used for testing and debugging your code before deploying it to production.
# 1. Set up production with Gunicorn

# 2. Serve a page with Nginx
Building on your work in the previous tasks, configure Nginx to serve your page from the route /airbnb-onepage/.

# 3. Add a route with query parameters

# 4. Let's do this for your API
Let’s serve what you built for AirBnB clone v3 - RESTful API on web-01.

# 5. Serve your AirBnB clone
Let’s serve what you built for AirBnB clone - Web dynamic on web-01.

# 6. Deploy it!
.
# 7. No service interruption
One of the most important metrics for any Internet-based business is its uptime. It is the percentage of the time over a given period that the service/product is accessible to customers. Let’s pick the example of Amazon.com, for every minute of downtime (which is the opposite of uptime), it costs the company $2M. Yet, application servers often need to restart to update with the new version of the code or new configuration, when doing this operation, an application server cannot serve traffic, which meant downtime.
